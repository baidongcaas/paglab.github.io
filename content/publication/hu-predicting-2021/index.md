abstract: Micronutrients are the key factors to evaluate the nutritional quality of
  wheat. However, measuring micronutrients is time-consuming and expensive. In this
  study, the potential of hyperspectral imaging for predicting wheat micronutrient
  content was investigated. The spectral reflectance of wheat kernels and flour was
  acquired in the visible and near-infrared range (VIS-NIR, 375–1050 nm). Afterwards,
  wheat micronutrient contents were measured and their associations with the spectra
  were modeled. Results showed that the models based on the spectral reflectance of
  wheat kernel achieved good predictions for Ca, Mg, Mo and Zn (r2textgreater0.70).
  The models based on the spectra reflectance of wheat flour showed good predictive
  capabilities for Mg, Mo and Zn (r2textgreater0.60). The prediction accuracy was
  higher for wheat kernels than for the flour. This study showed the feasibility of
  hyperspectral imaging as a non-invasive, non-destructive tool to predict micronutrients
  of wheat.
