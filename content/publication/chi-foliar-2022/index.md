abstract: Knowledge on the response of trees to the urban heat island (UHI) effect
  and soil sealing is currently limited, yet of vital importance in an era characterized
  by both climate change and urbanization. We investigated the physiological and phenological
  leaf plasticity of Tilia×euchlora trees to the UHI effect and soil sealing and explored
  the potential of leaf optical traits to quantify the magnitude of leaf plasticity.
  Temporal changes of leaf water content (LWC), specific leaf area (SLA), total chlorophyll
  (Chl) and carotenoids (Car) content, Car:Chl ratio and leaf reflectance for 46 Tilia×euchlora
  trees were measured along a soil sealing and urbanization gradient. The leaf functional
  traits displayed trait-specific temporal patterns during the growing season. We
  observed higher LWC and SLA but lower Chl and Car contents in the coolest zones.
  We found earlier autumn downregulation in Chl and Car content at paved sites compared
  to unsealed sites (maximum difference = 13 days). The magnitude of plasticity in
  relation to the UHI and soil sealing varied in leaf functional traits with largest
  variation observed in Chl (38%), followed by Car:Chl (31%), Car (29%), SLA (26%)
  and LWC (8%). The proposed spectral indices calculated using leaf reflectance measurements
  were able to track the spatiotemporal variations and phenology in the leaf functional
  traits. Our results clearly demonstrate the leaf plasticity of Tilia×euchlora trees,
  which provides Tilia×euchlora trees the necessary capacity to adapt to rapid changes
  in the urban environment. More importantly, we demonstrated the suitability of leaf
  optical traits to serve as a proxy of leaf functional traits for studying the spatiotemporal
  response of urban trees to environmental factors, which opens up new possibilities
  for large scale ecological studies using remote sensing.
