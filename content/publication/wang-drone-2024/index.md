abstract: Drone remote sensing has been increasingly demonstrated its unique advantage
  of monitoring vegetation and agricultural systems, yet the degree to which the effectiveness
  of drone imaging based spectral features may differ in assessing the effect of soil
  nutrient availability on plant canopy is unclear. Soil mineralized nitrogen (Nmin)
  is a key factor determining crop N fertilization demand, and thus understanding
  its effect on yield and quality is critical for efficient fertilizer use and precise
  crop N management and assessing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). In this study, our
  objective was to understand how soil Nmin variability is associated canopy characteristics,
  and whether these associations are also interact with grain yield, quality and NUE.
  For this purpose, we employed UAV multispectral remote sensing, and plant and grain
  sampling and sample N content determination in wheat growing at different Nmin levels.
  We extracted 63 spectral features (25 texture features, canopy height, 5 multispectral
  bands, and 23 spectral indices) obtained from eight UAV flights of RGB and multispectral
  images. Effective indicators were selected using random forests and correlation,
  and 10 machine learning models were used to predict NUE. We identified CH, NGRDI,
  NDREg, and IPCA as the most predictive factors for NUE (r textgreater 0.7), and
  the PLSR model (R2 textgreater 0.8) as the best performing model. We found that
  the impact of Nmin on wheat primarily involves enhancing canopy structure, promoting
  the expansion of leaf area, thereby increasing grain yield and NUE under moderate
  nitrogen fertilizer levels. In contrast, there was no significant effect found on
  grain quality. Results also demonstrated that the red edge spectral indices and
  color-band indices were effective in predicting NUE as early as the flowering stage.
  This study demonstrates the potential of UAV remote sensing for capturing soil N
  effect on canopy traits and for assessing nitrogen use efficiency for the purpose
  of improving fertilizer utilization and environmental effects.
