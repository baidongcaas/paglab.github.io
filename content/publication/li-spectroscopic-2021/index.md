abstract: Nitrogen (N) remobilization is a critical process that provides substantial
  N to winter wheat grains for improving yield productivity. Here, the remobilization
  of N from anthesis to maturity in two wheat cultivars under three irrigation regimes
  was measured and its relationship to organ N concentration was examined. Based on
  spectral data of organ powder samples, partial least squares regression (PLSR) models
  were calibrated to estimate N concentration (Nmass) and validated against with laboratory-based
  measurements. Although spectral reflectance could accurately estimate Nmass, the
  PLSR-based Nmass-spectra predictive model was found to be organ-specific, organs
  at the top canopy (chaff and top three leaves) received the best predictions (R2
  textgreater0.88). In addition, N remobilization efficiency (NRE) in the top two
  leaves and top third internode was highly correlated with its corresponding N concentration
  change (ΔNmass) with a R2 of 0.90. ΔNmass of the top first internode (TIN1) explained
  78% variation of the whole-plant NRE. This study provides a proof of concept for
  estimating N concentration and assessing N remobilization using hyperspectral data
  of individual organs, which offers a non-chemical and low-cost approach to screen
  germplasms for an optimal NRE in drought-resistance breeding.
