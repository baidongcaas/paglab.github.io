abstract: Deficit irrigation is a common approach in water-scarce regions to balance
  productivity and water use, whereas drought stress still occurs to various extents,
  leading to reduced physiological performance and a decrease in yield. Therefore,
  seeking a rapid and reliable method to identify wheat varieties with drought resistance
  can help reduce yield loss under water deficit. In this study, we compared ten wheat
  varieties under three deficit irrigation systems (W0, no irrigation during the growing
  season; W1, irrigation at jointing; W2, irrigation at jointing and anthesis). UAV
  thermal imagery, plant physiological traits [leaf area index (LAI), SPAD, photosynthesis
  (Pn), transpiration (Tr), stomatal conductance (Cn)], biomass and yield were acquired
  at different growth stages. Wheat drought resistance performance was evaluated through
  using the canopy temperature extracted from UAV thermal imagery (CT-UAV), in combination
  with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The CT-UAV of W0 and W1 treatments was
  significantly higher than in the W2 treatment, with the ranges of 24.8–33.3 °C,
  24.3–31.6 °C, and 24.1–28.9 °C in W0, W1 and W2, respectively. We found negative
  correlations between CT-UAV and LAI, SPAD, Pn, Tr, Cn and biomass under the W0 (R2
  = 0.41–0.79) and W1 treatments (R2 = 0.22–0.72), but little relevance for W2 treatment.
  Under the deficit irrigation treatments (W0 and W1), UAV thermal imagery was less
  effective before the grain-filling stage in evaluating drought resistance. This
  study demonstrates the potential of ensuring yield and saving irrigation water by
  identifying suitable wheat varieties for different water-scarce irrigation scenarios.
