abstract: The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important indicator in agriculture that
  can be considered a reliable plant growth parameter. The objective of this study
  is to make use of two different machine learning algorithms including Support Vector
  Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) to improve the estimation of leaf area index
  using multispectral, thermal, and hyperspectral data. The results showed that RF
  was the best model to improve the accuracy of the LAI estimation compared to the
  simple linear regression (previous study) and SVM (R2 = 0.91 for RF and R2 = 0.87
  for SVM). To evaluate the effects of spectral portions on LAI estimation without
  calculating the spectral indices, (SI) we inputted each pair of spectral bands for
  training and testing both RF and SVM. It was found that the best correlation was
  lower compared to use SIs. However, R2 variations were more homogeneous across the
  whole spectrum, which suggests that even by using multispectral broadband bands
  in RF and SVM, a good correlation will be achieved.
