abstract: New types of phenotyping tools generate large amounts of data on many aspects
  of plant physiology and morphology with high spatial and temporal resolution. These
  new phenotyping data are potentially useful to improve understanding and prediction
  of complex traits, like yield, that are characterized by strong environmental context
  dependencies, i.e., genotype by environment interactions. For an evaluation of the
  utility of new phenotyping information, we will look at how this information can
  be incorporated in different classes of genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models. G2P
  models predict phenotypic traits as functions of genotypic and environmental inputs.
  In the last decade, access to high-density single nucleotide polymorphism markers
  (SNPs) and sequence information has boosted the development of a class of G2P models
  called genomic prediction models that predict phenotypes from genome wide marker
  profiles. The challenge now is to build G2P models that incorporate simultaneously
  extensive genomic information alongside with new phenotypic information. Beyond
  the modification of existing G2P models, new G2P paradigms are required. We present
  candidate G2P models for the integration of genomic and new phenotyping information
  and illustrate their use in examples. Special attention will be given to the modelling
  of genotype by environment interactions. The G2P models provide a framework for
  model based phenotyping and the evaluation of the utility of phenotyping information
  in the context of breeding programs.
