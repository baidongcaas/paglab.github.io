abstract: 'Spectral indices rarely show consistency in estimating crop traits across
  growth stages; thus, it is critical to simultaneously evaluate a group of spectral
  variables and select the most informative spectral indices for retrieving crop traits.
  The objective of this study was to explore the optimal spectral predictors for above-ground
  biomass (AGB) by applying Random Forest (RF) on three types of spectral predictors:
  the full spectrum, published spectral indices (Pub-SIs), and optimized spectral
  indices (Opt-SIs). Canopy hyperspectral reflectance of potato plants, treated with
  seven nitrogen (N) rates, was obtained during the tuber formation and tuber bulking
  from 2015 to 2016. Twelve Pub-SIs were selected, and their spectral bands were optimized
  using band optimization algorithms. Results showed that the Opt-SIs were the best
  input variables of RF models. Compared to the best empirical model based on Opt-SIs,
  the Opt-SIs based RF model improved the prediction of AGB, with R2 increased by
  6%, 10%, and 16% at the tuber formation, tuber bulking, and for across the two growth
  stages, respectively. The Opt-SIs can significantly reduce the number of input variables.
  The optimized Blue nitrogen index (Opt-BNI) and Modified red-edge normalized difference
  vegetation index (Opt-mND705) combined with an RF model showed the best performance
  in estimating potato AGB at the tuber formation stage (R2 = 0.88). In the tuber
  bulking stage, only using optimized Nitrogen planar domain index (Opt-NPDI) as the
  input variable of the RF model produced satisfactory accuracy in training and testing
  datasets, with the R2, RMSE, and RE being 0.92, 208.6 kg/ha, and 10.3%, respectively.
  The Opt-BNI and Double-peak nitrogen index (Opt-NDDA) coupling with an RF model
  explained 86% of the variations in potato AGB, with the lowest RMSE (262.9 kg/ha)
  and RE (14.8%) across two growth stages. This study shows that combining the Opt-SIs
  and RF can greatly enhance the prediction accuracy for crop AGB while significantly
  reduces collinearity and redundancies of spectral data.'
