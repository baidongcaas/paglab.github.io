abstract: Biomass is an important parameter that has a decisive influence on the final
  yield. Destructive measurements of biomass are  time-consuming and labor-intensive.
  Proximal sensing methods using field spectrometers offer indirect observation and
  estimation of biomass. For this purpose, farmers' fields were investigated in a
  two-year growing season of rice and canopy reflectance was measured by spectrometers.
  Several vegetation indices (VIs) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models based
  on bands around the red-edge domain (680-760 nm) were tested. Published red-edge
  VIs were generally prone to saturation, whereas MLR models and the Ratio of Reflectance
  Difference Index in the red-edge (RRDIre) were less influenced by saturation. The
  linearly tested MLR (based on VIs) and the RRDIre models provided the best performance
  for biomass estimation in model validation using an independent dataset.
