 abstract = {Stem elongation is a critical phase for yield formation in wheat (Triticum aestivum). This study proposes the use of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for phenotyping of growth dynamics during wheat stem elongation in high temporal resolution and high throughput in the field. TLS was implemented on a novel field phenotyping platform carrying a cable suspended sensor head moveable in 3D over a 1 ha field. Canopy height was recorded on 335 winter wheat genotypes across two consecutive years. Scans were done in 3-d intervals during the stem elongation phase. Per day, 714 plots (two replications plus checks) were scanned within 3.5 h. The results showed that canopy height increased linearly with thermal time. Based on this linearity, 15 and 95% of final height were used as proxy measures for the onset and termination of stem elongation, respectively. We observed high heritability between 0.76 and 0.91 for the onset, termination and duration of stem elongation. The onset of stem elongation showed a positive covariance with the termination of stem elongation and final height indicating some regulatory dependencies. Yet there was no apparent relationship between onset and duration of stem elongation. Due to its precision, the TLS method allows to measure the dynamics of stem elongation in large sets of genotypes. This in turn offers opportunities to investigate the genetic control of the transitions between early vegetative growth, stem elongation and flowering. Understanding the genetic control of these transitions is an important milestone towards knowledge-based crop improvement.},
