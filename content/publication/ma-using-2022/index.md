abstract: "[Objectives]Monitoring crop moisture conditions in real-time is critical\
  \ for adopting water-saving irrigation and reducing China’s present water scarcity.\
  \ This study explores the feasibility of using drone multispectral image data for\
  \ real-time monitoring of maize drought stress and compares the sensitivity of drone\
  \ data and field-measured agronomic indicators to crop drought stress. [Methods]Two\
  \ maize cultivars, ‘Fumin 985’ and ‘Zhengdan 958’, were used as test materials in\
  \ the field experiment. Border irrigation, drip irrigation, and rainfed irrigation\
  \ were employed as treatments. The pigment content and specific leaf area (SLA)\
  \ of the most recently unfolded maize leaves were determined at 60, 70, 76, 84,\
  \ 90, and 95 days after sowing. Similarly, a UAV equipped with multi-spectral cameras\
  \ was used to collect near-ground remote sensing data to extract five vegetation\
  \ indexes: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference\
  \ vegetation index (GNDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), leaf chlorophyll\
  \ index (LCI), and optimum soil adjust vegetation index (OSAVI). [Results]The changes\
  \ in vegetation indexes were earlier than in the leaf pigment content and the leaf\
  \ area index. At 70 days after sowing (tasseling period), there was a significant\
  \ difference in the NDRE and LCI of the three treatments. NDVI, GNDVI, and OSAVI\
  \ indexes differed between the irrigation and rain-fed modes. No difference was\
  \ observed in the treatments' pigment content and specific leaf area index at the\
  \ same stages. At 90 days following sowing, there was a considerable difference\
  \ in pigment concentration among the treatments (filling period). Furthermore, correlation\
  \ analysis revealed that the relationship between vegetation indexes and pigment\
  \ content varied depending on the growth stage. The correlations between pigment\
  \ content and two vegetation indices (NDRE and LCI) were higher for 80 days after\
  \ sowing (flowering phase) than for NDVI, GNDVI, and OSAVI; for 90 days after sowing\
  \ (filling period), the correlation between the five vegetation indices and pigment\
  \ content was high. [Conclusions]According to this study, the utilization of UAV\
  \ multi-spectral data to monitor maize drought proved better than some measured\
  \ agronomic indicators. However, further research should be conducted on the best\
  \ spectral indicators and periods for drought monitoring in various situations and\
  \ environments. © 2022 by the authors."
