abstract: 'Urban trees provide many ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration,
  air quality improvement, storm water attenuation and energy conservation, to people
  living in cities. Provisioning of ecosystem services by urban trees, however, may
  be jeopardized by the typically poor quality of the soils in urban areas. Given
  their well-known multifunctional role in forest ecosystems, ectomycorrhizal fungi
  (EcM) may also contribute to urban tree health and thus ecosystem service provisioning.
  Yet, no studies so far have directly related in situ EcM community composition to
  urban tree health indicators. Here, two previously collected datasets were combined:
  i) tree health data of 175 Tilia tomentosa trees from three European cities (Leuven,
  Strasbourg and Porto) estimated using a range of reflectance, chlorophyll fluorescence
  and physical leaf indicators, and ii) ectomycorrhizal diversity of these trees as
  characterized by next-generation sequencing. Tree health indicators were related
  to soil characteristics and EcM diversity using canonical redundancy analysis. Soil
  organic matter significantly explained variation in tree health indicators whereas
  no significant relation between mycorrhizal diversity variables and the tree health
  indicators was found. We conclude that mainly soil organic matter, through promoting
  soil aggregate formation and porosity, and thus indirectly tree water availability,
  positively affects the health of trees in urban areas. Our results suggest that
  urban planners should not overlook the importance of soil quality and its water
  holding capacity for the health of urban trees and potentially also for the ecosystem
  services they deliver. Further research should also study other soil microbiota
  which may independently, or in interaction with ectomycorrhiza, mediate tree performance
  in urban settings.'
