abstract: Leaf diseases, such as powdery mildew and leaf rust, frequently infect barley
  plants and severely affect the economic value of malting barley. Early detection
  of barley diseases would facilitate the timely application of fungicides. In a field
  experiment, we investigated the performance of fluorescence and reflectance indices
  on (1) detecting barley disease risks when no fungicide is applied and (2) estimating
  leaf chlorophyll concentration (LCC). Leaf fluorescence and canopy reflectance were
  weekly measured by a portable fluorescence sensor and spectroradiometer, respectively.
  Results showed that vegetation indices recorded at canopy level performed well for
  the early detection of slightly-diseased plants. The combined reflectance index,
  MCARI/TCARI, yielded the best discrimination between healthy and diseased plants
  across seven barley varieties. The blue to far-red fluorescence ratio (BFRR_UV)
  and OSAVI were the best fluorescence and reflectance indices for estimating LCC,
  respectively, yielding R2 of 0.72 and 0.79. Partial least squares (PLS) and support
  vector machines (SVM) regression models further improved the use of fluorescence
  signals for the estimation of LCC, yielding R2 of 0.81 and 0.84, respectively. Our
  results demonstrate that non-destructive spectral measurements are able to detect
  mild disease symptoms before significant losses in LCC due to diseases under natural
  conditions.
