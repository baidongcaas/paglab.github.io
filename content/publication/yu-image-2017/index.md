abstract: Robust segmentation of canopy cover (CC) from large amounts of images taken
  under different illumination/light conditions in the field is essential for high
  throughput field phenotyping (HTFP). We attempted to address this challenge by evaluating
  different vegetation indices and segmentation methods for analyzing images taken
  at varying illuminations throughout the early growth phase of wheat in the field.
  40,000 images taken on 350 wheat genotypes in two consecutive years were assessed
  for this purpose.
