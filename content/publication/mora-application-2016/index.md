abstract: Many crops are ill-protected against insect pests during storage. To protect
  cereal grains from herbivores during storage, pesticides are often applied. While
  pesticides have an undoubtable functionality, increasing concerns are arising about
  their application. In the present study, we investigated a bioinspired cyanogenic
  grain coating with amygdalin as cyanogenic precursor mimicking the feeding-triggered
  release of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) found for example in bitter almonds. The multilayer
  coating consisted of biodegradable polylactic acid with individual layers containing
  amygdalin or Î²-glucosidase which is capable of degrading amygdalin to HCN. This
  reaction occurred only when the layers were ruptured, e.g., by a herbivore attack.
  Upon feeding coated cyanogenic wheat grains to Tenebrio molitor (mealworm beetle),
  Rhizopertha dominica (lesser grain borer), and Plodia interpunctella (Indianmeal
  moth), their reproduction as well as consumption rate were significantly reduced,
  whereas germination ability increased compared to noncoated grains. In field experiments,
  we observed an initial growth delay compared to uncoated grains which became negligible
  at later growth stages. The here shown strategy to artificially apply a naturally
  occurring defense mechanisms could be expanded to other crops than wheat and has
  the potential to replace certain pesticides with the benefit of complete biodegradability
  and increased safety during storage.
