abstract: Many empirical models based on hyperspectral indices (HIs) have been developed
  to estimate nitrogen (N) status of crops. However, most of the researches by far
  focused on the identification of sensitive bands of HIs, and have not identified
  the importance of formula formats to achieve their best performance. The current
  study aimed to investigate the response of band optimization and formula formats
  to canopy N concentration (CNC) of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants, and to
  verify the performance of HIs through optimized algorithms based on a multi-site
  and -year study. Three field experiments involving different potato cultivars with
  3–6 N rates were conducted from 2014 to 2016 in Inner Mongolia, China. The band
  optimization HIs were first tested using a simulated dataset by the PROSAIL model
  and validation dataset from farmers’ fields. Results showed that the optimized HIs
  generally had more robust performances for CNC prediction than the published indices.
  The optimized HIs explained 56%–74% of the variations in potato CNC in contrast
  with 3%–53% variation of the published HIs. Compared with published HIs, band optimization
  could significantly improve the performance of HIs by 16%–71%. The choice of the
  formula formats affected the explanatory power of the optimized HIs by 3%–18%. Our
  study found that both the performance of HIs and the position of the sensitive bands
  were greatly influenced by formula formats. The results from the evaluation of noise
  equivalent that independent from farmers’ field and PROSAIL model showed that the
  best performance was from Opt-CCCI. The central sensitive bands of Opt-CCCI were
  found at 600, 582, 650 nm. Opt-mRER also exhibited well in noise equivalent and
  independent validation from farmers’ field, while they could not be verified with
  the PROSAIL model because of the absence of the wavebands from 340 to 400 nm. Optimization
  for HIs indicates that there will be a great potential to improve the use of hyperspectral
  sensing for the estimation of field croṕs CNC.
