abstract: The deployment of novel technologies in the field of precision farming has
  risen to the top of global agendas in response to the impact of climate change and
  the possible shortage of resources such as water and fertilizers. The present research
  addresses the performance of water and nitrogen-sensitive narrow-band vegetation
  indices to evaluate the response of sweet maize (Zea mays var. saccharata L.) to
  different irrigation and nitrogen regimes. The experiment was carried out in Valenzano,
  Bari (Southern Italy), during the 2020 growing season. Three irrigation regimes
  (full irrigation, deficit irrigation, and rainfed) and two nitrogen levels (300
  and 50 kg ha−1) were tested. During the growing season, a Field Spec Handheld 2
  spectroradiometer operating in the range of 325–1075 nm was utilized to capture
  spectral data regularly. In addition, soil water content, biometric parameters,
  and physiological parameters were measured. The DATT index, based on near-infrared
  and red-edge wavelengths, performed better than other indices in explaining the
  variation in chlorophyll content, whereas the double difference index (DD) showed
  the greatest correlation with the leaf–gas exchange. The modified normalized difference
  vegetation index (NNDVI) and the ratio of water band index to normalized difference
  vegetation index (WBI/NDVI) showed the highest capacity to distinguish the interaction
  of irrigation x nitrogen, while the best discriminating capability of these indices
  was under a low nitrogen level. Moreover, red-edge-based indices had higher sensitivity
  to nitrogen levels compared to the structural and water band indices. Our study
  highlighted that it is critical to choose proper narrow-band vegetation indices
  to monitor the plant eco-physiological response to water and nitrogen stresses.
