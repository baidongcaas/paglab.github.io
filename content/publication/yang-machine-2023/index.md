abstract: Context Remotely estimating plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) at the vegetative
  growth stage plays a crucial role in the precision N management of field crops.
  However, the great challenges still remain on how to overcome the impact of canopy
  structure variation and the ‘N-dilution’ effect on the accuracy of PNC assessment
  using spectral indices (SIs). Objective This study was to apply machine learning
  (ML) algorithms fed with the optimized spectral indices (OSI), sensitive spectral
  bands (SSB), and full-spectrum (FS) to improve the prediction accuracy of PNC in
  critical vegetative growth stages of wheat, maize, rice, potato and the across crops.
  Methods Four ML algorithms including the partial least squares regression (PLSR),
  random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network
  (ANN) were compared for their efficacies in predicting PNC from ten field trials
  in different locations from 2005 to 2016. Results The input variable had a non-negligible
  influence on the performance of ML models. The OSI was the most efficient input
  variable for the tested ML algorithms in predicting PNC. The OSI-based RF models
  showed consistent outperformance compared to other models regardless of crops. The
  coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.51˗0.85 and the root means square error
  (RMSE) was 0.15% ˗ 0.34% in the experimental validation datasets. By choosing PNC-related
  spectral features across crops, the OSI-based RF models increased prediction accuracy
  by 10–31% compared with the best OSI-simple regression models, which was because
  the OSI-based RF models may be independent of canopy structure or the \"N-dilution\"
  impact. The simulated datasets based on the PROSAIL model and satellite multispectral
  bands further validated the results. Conclusions Our study concludes that the OSI-based
  RF is a robust and effective model to predict crop PNC at the vegetative growth
  stage. Significance The results of this study may provide insights into how to improve
  PNC assessment using the OSI-based RF models and deploy ML-based N recommendation
  models in the next generation of crop sensors.
