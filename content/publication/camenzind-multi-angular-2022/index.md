abstract: Barley awn coloring is a descriptive trait for barley (Hordeum vulgare)
  testing by the European Union. Rating the coloring visually is difficult and measuring
  canopy reflectance by a multispectral canopy might be more accurate. Reflectance
  of barley canopies with different awn coloring levels was measured from different
  viewing angles using a multispectral camera mounted to an unmanned aerial vehicle.
  The bi-directional reflectance distribution of the canopies was determined and used
  for deriving the anthocyanin reflection index, which was then used to identify the
  optimal viewing angles for the detection of Barley awn coloring. The index differed
  between the canopies without awn coloring and the canopies with awn coloring. The
  proposed method failed to detect subtle changes of awn coloring but it might be
  further improved and used to characterize canopy traits from multiple viewing angles.
