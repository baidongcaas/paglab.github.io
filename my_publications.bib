	abstract = {The influence of morphophysiological variation at different growth stages on the performance of vegetation indices for estimating plant N status has been confirmed. However, the underlying mechanisms explaining how this variation impacts hyperspectral measures and canopy N status are poorly understood. In this study, four field experiments involving different N rates were conducted to optimize the selection of sensitive bands and evaluate their performance for modeling canopy N status of rice at various growth stages in 2007 and 2008. The results indicate that growth stages negatively affect hyperspectral indices in different ways in modeling leaf N concentration (LNC), plant N concentration (PNC) and plant N uptake (PNU). Published hyperspectral indices showed serious limitations in estimating LNC, PNC and PNU. The newly proposed best 2-band indices significantly improved the accuracy for modeling PNU (R2 = 0.75–0.85) by using the lambda by lambda band-optimized algorithm. However, the newly proposed 2-band indices still have limitations in modeling LNC and PNC because the use of only 2-band indices is not fully adequate to provide the maximum N-related information. The optimum multiple narrow band reflectance (OMNBR) models significantly increase the accuracy for estimating the LNC (R2 = 0.67–0.71) and PNC (R2 = 0.57–0.78) with six bands. Results suggest the combinations of center of red-edge (735 nm) with longer red-edge bands (730–760 nm) are very efficient for estimating PNC after heading, whereas the combinations of blue with green bands are more efficient for modeling PNC across all stages. The center of red-edge (730–735 nm) paired with early NIR bands (775–808 nm) are predominant in estimating PNU before heading, whereas the longer red-edge (750 nm) paired with the center of “NIR shoulder” (840–850 nm) are dominant in estimating PNU after heading and across all stages. The OMNBR models have the advantage of modeling canopy N status for the entire growth period. However, the best 2-band indices are much easier to use. Alternatively, it is also possible to use the best 2-band indices to monitor PNU before heading and PNC after heading. This study systematically explains the influences of N dilution effect on hyperspectral band combinations in relating to the different N variables and further recommends the best band combinations which may provide an insight for developing new hyperspectral vegetation indices.},

Proximal sensing methods using field spectrometers offer indirect observation and estimation of biomass. For this purpose, farmers' fields were investigated in a two-year growing season of rice and canopy reflectance was measured by spectrometers. Several vegetation indices (VIs) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models based on bands around the red-edge domain (680-760 nm) were tested. Published red-edge VIs were generally prone to saturation, whereas MLR models and the Ratio of Reflectance Difference Index in the red-edge (RRDIre) were less influenced by saturation. The linearly tested MLR (based on VIs) and the RRDIre models provided the best performance for biomass estimation in model validation using an independent dataset.},

Early detection of barley diseases would facilitate the timely application of fungicides. In a field experiment, we investigated the performance of fluorescence and reflectance indices on (1) detecting barley disease risks when no fungicide is applied and (2) estimating leaf chlorophyll concentration (LCC). Leaf fluorescence and canopy reflectance were weekly measured by a portable fluorescence sensor and spectroradiometer, respectively. Results showed that vegetation indices recorded at canopy level performed well for the early detection of slightly-diseased plants. The combined reflectance index, MCARI/TCARI, yielded the best discrimination between healthy and diseased plants across seven barley varieties. The blue to far-red fluorescence ratio (BFRR\_UV) and OSAVI were the best fluorescence and reflectance indices for estimating LCC, respectively, yielding R2 of 0.72 and 0.79. Partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machines (SVM) regression models further improved the use of fluorescence signals for the estimation of LCC, yielding R2 of 0.81 and 0.84, respectively. Our results demonstrate that non-destructive spectral measurements are able to detect mild disease symptoms before significant losses in LCC due to diseases under natural conditions.},

	abstract = {Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Ratio Vegetation Index obtained with the fixed band GreenSeeker active multispectral canopy sensor (GS-NDVI and GS-RVI) have been commonly used to non-destructively estimate crop growth parameters and support precision crop management, but their performance has been influenced by soil and/or water backgrounds at early crop growth stages and saturation effects at moderate to high biomass conditions. Our objective is to improve estimation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) aboveground biomass (AGB) with hyperspectral canopy sensing by identifying more optimal measurements using one or more strategies: (a) soil adjusted Vegetation Indices (VIs); (b) optimized narrow band RVI and NDVI; and (c) Optimum Multiple Narrow Band Reflectance (OMNBR) models based on raw reflectance, and its first and second derivatives (FDR and SDR).

Six rice nitrogen (N) rate experiments were conducted in Jiansanjiang, Heilongjiang province of Northeast China from 2007 to 2009 to create different biomass conditions. Hyperspectral field data and AGB samples were collected at four growth stages from tillering through heading from both experimental and farmers’ fields. The results indicate that six-band OMNBR models (R2 = 0.44–0.73) explained 21–35\% more AGB variability relative to the best performing fixed band RVI or NDVI at different growth stages. The FDR-based 6-band OMNBR models explained 4\%, 6\% and 8\% more variability of AGB than raw reflectance-based 6-band OMNBR models at the stem elongation (R2 = 0.77), booting (R2 = 0.50), and heading stages (R2 = 0.57), respectively. The SDR-based 6-band OMNBR models made no further improvements, except for the stem elongation stage. Optimized RVI and NDVI for each growth stage (R2 = 0.34–0.69) explained 18–26\% more variability in AGB than the best performing fixed band RVI or NDVI. The FDR- and SDR-based optimized VIs made no further improvements. These results were consistent across different sites and years. It is concluded that with suitable band combinations, optimized narrow band RVI or NDVI could significantly improve estimation of rice AGB at different growth stages, without the need of derivative analysis. Six-band OMNBR models can further improve the estimation of AGB over optimized 2-band VIs, with the best performance using SDR at the stem elongation stage and FDR at other growth stages.},

	abstract = {This paper contributes an assessment for estimating rice (Oryza sativa L., irrigated low-land rice) biomass by canopy reflectance in the Sanjiang Plain, China. Hyperspectral data were captured with field spectroradiometers in experimental field plots and farmers' fields and then accompanied by destructive aboveground biomass (AGB) sampling at different phenological growth stages. Best single bands, best two band-combinations, optimised simple ratio (SR), and optimised normalized ratio index (NRI), as well as multiple linear regression (MLR) were calculated from the reflectance for the non-destructive estimation of rice AGB. Experimental field data were used as the calibration dataset and farmers' field data as the validation dataset. Reflectance analyses display several sensitive bands correlated to rice AGB, e.g.550, 670, 708, 936, 1125, and 1670 nm, which changed depending on the phenological growth stages. These bands were detected by correlograms for SR, NRI, and MLR with an offset of approximately ± 10 nm. The assessment of the three methods showed clear advantages of MLR over SR and NRI in estimating rice AGB at the tillering and stem elongation stages by fitting and evaluating the models. The optimal band number for MLR was set to four to avoid overfitting. The best validated MLR model (R 2 = 0.82) at the tillering stage was using four bands at 672, 696, 814 and 707 nm. Overall, the optimized SR, NRI, and MLR have a great potential in non-destructive estimation of rice AGB at different phenological stages. The performance against the validation dataset showed R 2 of 0.69 for SR and R 2 of 0.70 for NRI, respectively. Dieser Beitrag versucht eine Bewertung zur Biomassenabschätzung von Kulturreis (Oryza sativa L., bewässerter Flachland-Kulturreis) mit Hilfe von Bestandsreflexion in der Sanjiang Ebene, China. Hyperspektrale Daten wurden in Freilandexperimenten und in Feldern von Landwirten mit Feldspektroradiometern gemessen. Nach den Spektralmessungen wurde die oberirdische Biomasse destruktiv in unterschiedlichen phänologischen Wachstumsstadien gemessen. Beste einzelne Bänder, beste Zweibandkombinationen, optimierter Simple Ratio (SR) und Normalisierter Ratio Index (NRI), sowie Multiple Regressionsanalyse (MLR) wurden anhand von Reflexionsdaten der Freilandexperimente berechnet. Die Daten von den Feldern der Landwirte wurden als Validierungsdatensatz verwendet. Die Reflexionsanalysen zeigen mehrere zur Biomasse korrelierend sensitive Bänder, z. B. 550 nm, 670 nm, 708 nm, 936 nm, 1125 nm und 1670 nm, welche sich in Abhängigkeit von phänologischen Wachstumsstadienänderten. Diese Bänder wurden mittels Korrelogramme für SR, NRI und MLR mit einem Versatz von ca. ± 10 nm detektiert. Die Bewertung der drei Methoden zeigte deutliche Vorteile von MLR gegenüber SR und NRI in der Biomassenabschätzung für Reis im Bestockungsund Ährenschwellenstadium. Die optimale Bandanzahl für MLR wurde auf vier festgesetzt, um eine Überanpassung zu vermeiden. Das beste MLR-Modell (R 2 = 0.82) zum Bestockungsstadium basiert auf vier Bändern (672 nm, 696 nm, 814 nm und 707 nm). Die Analyse von hyperspektralen Reflexionsdaten zur Optimierung von VIs oder MLR hat ein großes Potential in der Biomassenabschätzung für Reis in unterschiedlichen phänologischen Stadien. Dies wird durch die gute Übertragbarkeit (R 2 = 0.69 für SR und R 2 = 0.70 für NRI) der optimierten Modelle in die landwirtschaftliche Praxis unterstrichen.},

	abstract = {Monitoring in situ chlorophyll (Chl) content in agricultural crop leaves is of great importance for stress detection, nutritional state diagnosis, yield prediction and studying the mechanisms of plant and environment interaction. Numerous spectral indices have been developed for chlorophyll estimation from leaf- and canopy-level reflectance. However, in most cases, these indices are negatively affected by variations in canopy structure and soil background. The objective of this study was to develop spectral indices that can reduce the effects of varied canopy structure and growth stages for the estimation of leaf Chl. Hyperspectral reflectance data was obtained through simulation by a radiative transfer model, PROSAIL, and measurements from canopies of barley comprising different cultivars across growth stages using spectroradiometers. We applied a comprehensive band-optimization algorithm to explore five types of spectral indices: reflectance difference (RD), reflectance ratio (RR), normalized reflectance difference (NRD), difference of reflectance ratio (DRR) and ratio of reflectance difference (RRD). Indirectly using the multiple scatter correction (MSC) theory, we hypothesized that RRD can eliminate adverse effects of soil background, canopy structure and multiple scattering. Published indices and multivariate models such as optimum multiple band regression (OMBR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machines for regression (SVR) were also employed. Results showed that the ratio of reflectance difference index (RRDI) optimized for simulated data significantly improved the correlation with Chl (R2 = 0.98, p \&lt; 0.0001) and was insensitive to LAI variations (1–8), compared to widely used indices such as MCARI/OSAVI (R2 = 0.64, p \&lt; 0.0001) and TCARI/OSAVI (R2 = 0.74, p \&lt; 0.0001). The RRDI optimized for barley explained 76\% of the variation in Chl and outperformed multivariate models. However, the accuracy decreased when employing the indices for individual growth stages (R2 \&lt; 0.59). Accordingly, RRDIs optimized for open and closed canopies improved the estimations of Chl for individual stages before and after canopy closure, respectively, with R2 of 0.65 (p \&lt; 0.0001) and 0.78 (p \&lt; 0.0001). This study shows that RRDI can efficiently eliminate the effects of structural properties on canopy reflectance response to canopy biochemistry. The results yet are limited to the datasets used in this study; therefore, transferability of the methods to large scales or other datasets should be further evaluated.},

	abstract = {In this study we combined selected vegetation indices (VIs) and plant height information to estimate biomass in a summer barley experiment. The VIs were calculated from ground-based hyperspectral data and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based red green blue (RGB) imaging. In addition, the plant height information was obtained from UAV-based multi-temporal crop surface models (CSMs). The test site is a summer barley experiment comprising 18 cultivars and two nitrogen treatments located in Western Germany. We calculated five VIs from hyperspectral data. The normalised ratio index (NRI)-based index GnyLi (Gnyp et al., 2014) showed the highest correlation (R2 = 0.83) with dry biomass. In addition, we calculated three visible band VIs: the green red vegetation index (GRVI), the modified GRVI (MGRVI) and the red green blue VI (RGBVI), where the MGRVI and the RGBVI are newly developed VI. We found that the visible band VIs have potential for biomass prediction prior to heading stage. A robust estimate for biomass was obtained from the plant height models (R2 = 0.80–0.82). In a cross validation test, we compared plant height, selected VIs and their combination with plant height information. Combining VIs and plant height information by using multiple linear regression or multiple non-linear regression models performed better than the VIs alone. The visible band GRVI and the newly developed RGBVI are promising but need further investigation. However, the relationship between plant height and biomass produced the most robust results. In summary, the results indicate that plant height is competitive with VIs for biomass estimation in summer barley. Moreover, visible band VIs might be a useful addition to biomass estimation. The main limitation is that the visible band VIs work for early growing stages only.},

	abstract = {In this study field experiments were conducted to test the ability of optimized spectral indices and partial least squares (PLS) to estimate leaf chlorophyll (Chl) content of rice from non-destructive canopy reflectance measurements. We integrated techniques involving the optimization of narrow band spectral indices and the detection of red edge position to optimize one type of spectral indices, the ratio of reflectance difference index (RRDI), for the estimation of leaf Chl content. The optimized RRDI in the red-edge (RRDIre = (R745–R740)/(R740–R700)) accounted for 62\% – 72\% of the variation in leaf Chl content with an RMSE of 4.59 μg/cm2 – 4.89 μg/cm2. Compared to spectral indices, PLS improved the estimation of leaf Chl content, yielding R2 and RMSE of 0.85 μg/cm2 and 3.22 μg/cm2, respectively. Finally, the model based on RRDI and the PLS model were further validated by an independent dataset collected in farmer fields. RRDI and PLS models yielded acceptable accuracy with R2 of 0.49 and 0.55, respectively, and an RMSE of 5.47 μg/cm2 and 5.13 μg/cm2. Our results suggest the potential to optimize spectral indices and also the significance of PLS technique for mapping canopy biochemical variations.

Der optimierte RRDI im red-edge (RRDI-re = (R745–R740)/(R740–R700)) erklärte 62\% – 72\% von der Variabilität des Blatt-Chlorophyllgehalts mit einem RMSE von 4.59 μg/cm2 – 4.89 μg/cm2. Im Vergleich zu etablierten Spektralindizes kann mittels der PLS Analyse die Abschätzung von Blatt-Chlorophyllgehalten signifikant verbessert werden (R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 3.22 μg/cm2). Schließlich wurden die RRDI- und PLS-basierten Modelle anhand eines unabhängigen Datensatzes, der auf landwirtschaftlich genutzten Feldern erhoben wurde, zusätzlich validiert. Die RRDI- und PLS-Modelle erzielten eine akzeptable Genauigkeit mit jeweils einem R² von 0.49 und 0.55 und einem RMSE von 5.47 μg/cm2 und 5.13 μg/cm2.

	abstract = {China consumes more than 1/3 of global N fertilizers for rice with less than 1/5 of the world rice planting area. As a consequence, N efficiency is low and nitrate pollution risk is high. Developing efficient N management strategies and technologies for rice are therefore needed. Here, we developed an active canopy sensor-based precision N management strategy for rice in Northeast China. Four site-years of field N rate experiments were conducted in 2008 and 2009 in Sanjiang Plain, Heilongjiang, China. The GreenSeeker active sensor was used to collect rice canopy reflectance data at different growth stages. Three on-farm experiments were conducted in 2011 to evaluate the performance of the developed strategy. The results show that the crop sensor can be used to calculate rice yield potential without additional topdressing N application at stem elongation or booting stage. The GreenSeeker-based precision N management strategy has a regional optimum N rate of 90–110 kg N ha−1 as initial total amount and 45 and 20 \% as basal and tillering N application. It uses the crop sensor to estimate the topdressing N rate at stem elongation stage. GreenSeeker-based precision management and chlorophyll meter-based site-specific N management increased the partial factor productivity of farmers by 48 and 65 \%, respectively, without significant change in grain yield. The crop sensor-based N management strategy can therefore improve N use efficiency of rice. It is more suitable for practical on-farm applications, and will contribute to the sustainable development of rice farming.},

	abstract = {Many crops are ill-protected against insect pests during storage. To protect cereal grains from herbivores during storage, pesticides are often applied. While pesticides have an undoubtable functionality, increasing concerns are arising about their application. In the present study, we investigated a bioinspired cyanogenic grain coating with amygdalin as cyanogenic precursor mimicking the feeding-triggered release of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) found for example in bitter almonds. The multilayer coating consisted of biodegradable polylactic acid with individual layers containing amygdalin or β-glucosidase which is capable of degrading amygdalin to HCN. This reaction occurred only when the layers were ruptured, e.g., by a herbivore attack. Upon feeding coated cyanogenic wheat grains to Tenebrio molitor (mealworm beetle), Rhizopertha dominica (lesser grain borer), and Plodia interpunctella (Indianmeal moth), their reproduction as well as consumption rate were significantly reduced, whereas germination ability increased compared to noncoated grains. In field experiments, we observed an initial growth delay compared to uncoated grains which became negligible at later growth stages. The here shown strategy to artificially apply a naturally occurring defense mechanisms could be expanded to other crops than wheat and has the potential to replace certain pesticides with the benefit of complete biodegradability and increased safety during storage.},

	abstract = {Stem elongation is a critical phase for yield formation in wheat (Triticum aestivum). This study proposes the use of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for phenotyping of growth dynamics during wheat stem elongation in high temporal resolution and high throughput in the field. TLS was implemented on a novel field phenotyping platform carrying a cable suspended sensor head moveable in 3D over a 1 ha field. Canopy height was recorded on 335 winter wheat genotypes across two consecutive years. Scans were done in 3-d intervals during the stem elongation phase. Per day, 714 plots (two replications plus checks) were scanned within 3.5 h. The results showed that canopy height increased linearly with thermal time. Based on this linearity, 15 and 95\% of final height were used as proxy measures for the onset and termination of stem elongation, respectively. We observed high heritability between 0.76 and 0.91 for the onset, termination and duration of stem elongation. The onset of stem elongation showed a positive covariance with the termination of stem elongation and final height indicating some regulatory dependencies. Yet there was no apparent relationship between onset and duration of stem elongation. Due to its precision, the TLS method allows to measure the dynamics of stem elongation in large sets of genotypes. This in turn offers opportunities to investigate the genetic control of the transitions between early vegetative growth, stem elongation and flowering. Understanding the genetic control of these transitions is an important milestone towards knowledge-based crop improvement.},

	abstract = {Quantitative resistance is likely to be more durable than major gene resistance for controlling Septoria tritici blotch (STB) on wheat. Earlier studies hypothesized that resistance affecting the degree of host damage, as measured by the percentage of leaf area covered by STB lesions, is distinct from resistance that affects pathogen reproduction, as measured by the density of pycnidia produced within lesions. We tested this hypothesis using a collection of 335 elite European winter wheat cultivars that was naturally infected by a diverse population of Zymoseptoria tritici in a replicated field experiment. We used automated image analysis of 21,420 scanned wheat leaves to obtain quantitative measures of conditional STB intensity that were precise, objective, and reproducible. These measures allowed us to explicitly separate resistance affecting host damage from resistance affecting pathogen reproduction, enabling us to confirm that these resistance traits are largely independent. The cultivar rankings based on host damage were different from the rankings based on pathogen reproduction, indicating that the two forms of resistance should be considered separately in breeding programs aiming to increase STB resistance. We hypothesize that these different forms of resistance are under separate genetic control, enabling them to be recombined to form new cultivars that are highly resistant to STB. We found a significant correlation between rankings based on automated image analysis and rankings based on traditional visual scoring, suggesting that image analysis can complement conventional measurements of STB resistance, based largely on host damage, while enabling a much more precise measure of pathogen reproduction. We showed that measures of pathogen reproduction early in the growing season were the best predictors of host damage late in the growing season, illustrating the importance of breeding for resistance that reduces pathogen reproduction in order to minimize yield losses caused by STB. These data can already be used by breeding programs to choose wheat cultivars that are broadly resistant to naturally diverse Z. tritici populations according to the different classes of resistance.},

	abstract = {Urban trees play a key role in mitigating environmental problems in cities, but they often face harsh environmental conditions as they generally grow in sealed soils that have small rooting space and low water availability. In this context, rapid monitoring and assessment of tree health status is critical to maintain urban trees and secure the provisioning of urban ecosystem services. Across three European cities we selected 187 Tilia tomentosa trees growing under following planting conditions: (i) sealed, trees planted in small soil pits or strips surrounded by highly sealed surfaces (concrete, pavement or asphalt); and (ii) unsealed, trees planted in roomy soil surfaces (e.g. parks). We measured leaf reflectance and fluorescence and derived a set of optical traits from the measurements. We examined whether these non-destructively measured optical traits differ between planting conditions and whether they correlate with leaf functional traits, e.g. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf water content (LWC) and leaf water per area (LWA). Compared to the unsealed trees, sealed trees showed decreased SLA and LWC while increased LWA. Leaf optical traits differed between the unsealed and sealed trees. Highly sealed soils accelerated leaf senescence of the sealed trees compared to the unsealed trees, embodied in the temporal trend of optical traits. Sealed planting conditions negatively affect urban tree health status and phenology. These negative effects can be estimated by leaf optical traits, demonstrating the great potential of optical traits in assessing tree health status. Our findings provide insights into facilitating urban green management using optical traits and remote sensing data.},

	abstract = {Heavy metals in urban soils may impose a threat to public health and may negatively affect urban tree viability. Vegetation spectroscopy techniques applied to bio-indicators bring new opportunities to characterize heavy metal contamination, without being constrained by laborious soil sampling and lab-based sample processing. Here we used Tilia tomentosa trees, sampled across three European cities, as bio-indicators i) to investigate the impacts of elevated concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) on leaf mass per area (LMA), total chlorophyll content (Chl), chlorophyll a to b ratio (Chla:Chlb) and the maximal PSII photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm); and ii) to evaluate the feasibility of detecting Cd and Pb contamination using leaf reflectance spectra. For the latter, we used a partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to train spectral-based models for the classification of Cd and/or Pb contamination. We show that elevated soil Pb concentrations induced a significant decrease in the LMA and Chla:Chlb, with no decrease in Chl. We did not observe pronounced reductions of Fv/Fm due to Cd and Pb contamination. Elevated Cd and Pb concentrations induced contrasting spectral changes in the red-edge (690–740 nm) region, which might be associated with the proportional changes in leaf pigments. PLS-DA models allowed for the classifications of Cd and Pb contamination, with a classification accuracy of 86\% (Kappa = 0.48) and 83\% (Kappa = 0.66), respectively. PLS-DA models also allowed for the detection of a collective elevation of soil Cd and Pb, with an accuracy of 66\% (Kappa = 0.49). This study demonstrates the potential of using reflectance spectroscopy for biomonitoring of heavy metal contamination in urban soils.},

	abstract = {In-season diagnosis of crop nitrogen (N) status is crucial for precision N management. Critical N (Nc) dilution curve and N nutrition index (NNI) have been proposed as effective methods to diagnose N status of different crops. The Nc dilution curves have been developed for indica rice in the tropical and temperate zones and japonica rice in the subtropical-temperate zone, but they have not been evaluated for short-season japonica rice in Northeast China. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the previously developed Nc dilution curves for rice in Northeast China and to develop a more suitable Nc dilution curve in this region. A total of 17 N rate experiments were conducted in Sanjiang Plain, Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China from 2008 to 2013. The results indicated that none of the two previously developed Nc dilution curves was suitable to diagnose N status of the short-season japonica rice in Northeast China. A new Nc dilution curve was developed and can be described by the equation Nc = 27.7W−0.34 if W ≥ 1 Mg dry matter (DM) ha−1 or Nc = 27.7 g kg−1 DM if W {\textless} 1 Mg DM ha−1, where W is the aboveground biomass. This new curve was lower than the previous curves. It was validated using a separate dataset, and it could discriminate non-N-limiting and N-limiting nutritional conditions. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate it for diagnosing N status of different rice cultivars in Northeast China and develop efficient non-destructive methods to estimate NNI for practical applications.},

Hyperspectral remote sensing has shown potential for the detection of plant diseases, but its utility for phenotyping large and diverse populations of plants under field conditions requires further evaluation. In this study, we collected canopy hyperspectral data from 335 wheat varieties using a spectroradiometer, and we investigated the use of canopy reflectance for detecting the Septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease and for quantifying the severity of infection. Canopy- and leaf-level infection metrics of STB based on traditional visual assessments and automated analyses of leaf images were used as ground truth data. Results showed i) that canopy reflectance and the selected spectral indices show promise for quantifying STB infections, and ii) that the normalized difference water index (NDWI) showed the best performance in detecting STB compared to other spectral indices. Moreover, partial least squares (PLS) regression models allowed for an improvement in the prediction of STB metrics. The PLS discriminant analysis (PLSDA) model calibrated based on the spectral data of four reference varieties was able to discriminate between the diseased and healthy canopies among the 335 varieties with an accuracy of 93\% (Kappa = 0.60). Finally, the PLSDA model predictions allowed for the identification of wheat genotypes that are potentially more susceptible to STB, which was confirmed by the STB visual assessment. This study demonstrates the great potential of using canopy hyperspectral remote sensing to improve foliar disease assessment and to facilitate plant breeding for disease resistance.},

This study investigated the capability of hyperspectral (HSI) and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (CFI) to characterize individual and interactive frost (−4 °C) and drought (40\% soil moisture content) stress responses at the booting stage of wheat under controlled environmental conditions. HSI full range reflectance (280–2500 nm), CFI, and traditional responses (leaf water content, photosynthesis, and enzymatic activity) were measured from flag leaves. The potentiality of HSI to detect cellular damage in terms of enzymatic activity was explored by developing partial least square regression (PLSR) models, and spectral indices were calculated to characterize the responses to individual and combined stresses. Reflectance in 360, 700, 1400, 1900, and 2460 nm wavebands showed the most important variables in developing PLSR models for enzymes. Superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase showed the highest R2c (0.99, 0.95, and 0.98), R2v (0.94, 0.90, 0.93), and the ratio of prediction to deviation (4.04, 3.06, and 3.85). CFI decreased under individual frost and combined frost and drought stresses. Ratio vegetation stress index (RVSI), green difference vegetation index (GDVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were the most important variables and could be used to detect combined frost and drought by determining enzymatic activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS), verified by PLSR models. Spectral indices and enzyme activities showed a strong correlation in determining yield losses. Hence, HSI and CFI techniques successfully detected combined frost and drought stresses for rapid quantification.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) remobilization is a critical process that provides substantial N to winter wheat grains for improving yield productivity. Here, the remobilization of N from anthesis to maturity in two wheat cultivars under three irrigation regimes was measured and its relationship to organ N concentration was examined. Based on spectral data of organ powder samples, partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were calibrated to estimate N concentration (Nmass) and validated against with laboratory-based measurements. Although spectral reflectance could accurately estimate Nmass, the PLSR-based Nmass-spectra predictive model was found to be organ-specific, organs at the top canopy (chaff and top three leaves) received the best predictions (R2 {\textgreater}0.88). In addition, N remobilization efficiency (NRE) in the top two leaves and top third internode was highly correlated with its corresponding N concentration change (ΔNmass) with a R2 of 0.90. ΔNmass of the top first internode (TIN1) explained 78\% variation of the whole-plant NRE. This study provides a proof of concept for estimating N concentration and assessing N remobilization using hyperspectral data of individual organs, which offers a non-chemical and low-cost approach to screen germplasms for an optimal NRE in drought-resistance breeding.},

	abstract = {New types of phenotyping tools generate large amounts of data on many aspects of plant physiology and morphology with high spatial and temporal resolution. These new phenotyping data are potentially useful to improve understanding and prediction of complex traits, like yield, that are characterized by strong environmental context dependencies, i.e., genotype by environment interactions. For an evaluation of the utility of new phenotyping information, we will look at how this information can be incorporated in different classes of genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models. G2P models predict phenotypic traits as functions of genotypic and environmental inputs. In the last decade, access to high-density single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) and sequence information has boosted the development of a class of G2P models called genomic prediction models that predict phenotypes from genome wide marker profiles. The challenge now is to build G2P models that incorporate simultaneously extensive genomic information alongside with new phenotypic information. Beyond the modification of existing G2P models, new G2P paradigms are required. We present candidate G2P models for the integration of genomic and new phenotyping information and illustrate their use in examples. Special attention will be given to the modelling of genotype by environment interactions. The G2P models provide a framework for model based phenotyping and the evaluation of the utility of phenotyping information in the context of breeding programs.},

	abstract = {The ability of a genotype to stay green affects the primary target traits grain yield (GY) and grain protein concentration (GPC) in wheat. High throughput methods to assess senescence dynamics in large field trials will allow for i) indirect selection in early breeding generations, when yield cannot yet be accurately determined and ii) mapping of the genomic regions controlling the trait. The aim of this study was to develop a robust method to assess senescence based on hyperspectral canopy reflectance. Measurements were taken in three years throughout the grain filling phase on {\textgreater}300 winter wheat varieties in the spectral range from 350 to 2500 nm using a spectroradiometer. We compared the potential of spectral indices (SI) and full-spectrum models to infer visually observed senescence dynamics from repeated reflectance measurements. Parameters describing the dynamics of senescence were used to predict GY and GPC and a feature selection algorithm was used to identify the most predictive features. The three-band plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) approximated the visually observed senescence dynamics best, whereas full-spectrum models suffered from a strong year-specificity. Feature selection identified visual scorings as most predictive for GY, but also PSRI ranked among the most predictive features while adding additional spectral features had little effect. Visually scored delayed senescence was positively correlated with GY ranging from r = 0.173 in 2018 to r = 0.365 in 2016. It appears that visual scoring remains the gold standard to quantify leaf senescence in moderately large trials. However, using appropriate phenotyping platforms, the proposed index-based parameterization of the canopy reflectance dynamics offers the critical advantage of upscaling to very large breeding trials.},

	abstract = {Urban trees provide many ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, air quality improvement, storm water attenuation and energy conservation, to people living in cities. Provisioning of ecosystem services by urban trees, however, may be jeopardized by the typically poor quality of the soils in urban areas. Given their well-known multifunctional role in forest ecosystems, ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcM) may also contribute to urban tree health and thus ecosystem service provisioning. Yet, no studies so far have directly related in situ EcM community composition to urban tree health indicators. Here, two previously collected datasets were combined: i) tree health data of 175 Tilia tomentosa trees from three European cities (Leuven, Strasbourg and Porto) estimated using a range of reflectance, chlorophyll fluorescence and physical leaf indicators, and ii) ectomycorrhizal diversity of these trees as characterized by next-generation sequencing. Tree health indicators were related to soil characteristics and EcM diversity using canonical redundancy analysis. Soil organic matter significantly explained variation in tree health indicators whereas no significant relation between mycorrhizal diversity variables and the tree health indicators was found. We conclude that mainly soil organic matter, through promoting soil aggregate formation and porosity, and thus indirectly tree water availability, positively affects the health of trees in urban areas. Our results suggest that urban planners should not overlook the importance of soil quality and its water holding capacity for the health of urban trees and potentially also for the ecosystem services they deliver. Further research should also study other soil microbiota which may independently, or in interaction with ectomycorrhiza, mediate tree performance in urban settings.},

Each spikelet produced the maximum number of living floret primordia (MFP) and showed no difference between treatments at the W7.5 stage; this ability was hardly affected by treatments. We firstly found that gradually abortive florets during W8.5-W10 stages were delayed due to improving assimilates availability in the spike instead of the 4th-5th inthernode; in fact, these florets would be aborted completely and never become fertile florets. Notably, we found that those florets in which the anther turned green (value ≥ 97) at W7.5 always became fertile, and their number showed a significant positive relationship with number of fertile florets (NFF) at W10. Collectively, more available assimilates in spike accelerated anther turning green during period of early floret development, maintained their development normally and becoming fertile florets, but did not make florets that initiate abortion become fertile florets and increase the MFP.},

In this study, tree health was represented by a set of field-assessed tree health indicators (defoliation, discoloration, and a combination thereof), which were classified using airborne laser scanning (ALS) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) with a Random Forest classifier. Different classification scenarios were established aiming at: (i) Comparing the performance of ALS data, HSI and their combination, and (ii) examining to what extent tree species mixtures affect classification accuracy. Our results show that although the predictive power of ALS and HSI indices varied between tree species and tree health indicators, overall ALS indices performed better. The combined use of both ALS and HSI indices results in the highest accuracy, with weighted kappa coefficients (Kc) ranging from 0.53 to 0.79 and overall accuracy ranging from 0.81 to 0.89. Overall, the most informative remote sensing indices indicating urban tree health are ALS indices related to point density, tree size, and shape, and HSI indices associated with chlorophyll absorption. Our results further indicate that a species-specific modelling approach is advisable (Kc points improved by 0.07 on average compared with a mixed species modelling approach). Our study constitutes a basis for future urban tree health monitoring, which will enable managers to guide early remediation management.},

	abstract = {Spectral indices rarely show consistency in estimating crop traits across growth stages; thus, it is critical to simultaneously evaluate a group of spectral variables and select the most informative spectral indices for retrieving crop traits. The objective of this study was to explore the optimal spectral predictors for above-ground biomass (AGB) by applying Random Forest (RF) on three types of spectral predictors: the full spectrum, published spectral indices (Pub-SIs), and optimized spectral indices (Opt-SIs). Canopy hyperspectral reflectance of potato plants, treated with seven nitrogen (N) rates, was obtained during the tuber formation and tuber bulking from 2015 to 2016. Twelve Pub-SIs were selected, and their spectral bands were optimized using band optimization algorithms. Results showed that the Opt-SIs were the best input variables of RF models. Compared to the best empirical model based on Opt-SIs, the Opt-SIs based RF model improved the prediction of AGB, with R2 increased by 6\%, 10\%, and 16\% at the tuber formation, tuber bulking, and for across the two growth stages, respectively. The Opt-SIs can significantly reduce the number of input variables. The optimized Blue nitrogen index (Opt-BNI) and Modified red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (Opt-mND705) combined with an RF model showed the best performance in estimating potato AGB at the tuber formation stage (R2 = 0.88). In the tuber bulking stage, only using optimized Nitrogen planar domain index (Opt-NPDI) as the input variable of the RF model produced satisfactory accuracy in training and testing datasets, with the R2, RMSE, and RE being 0.92, 208.6 kg/ha, and 10.3\%, respectively. The Opt-BNI and Double-peak nitrogen index (Opt-NDDA) coupling with an RF model explained 86\% of the variations in potato AGB, with the lowest RMSE (262.9 kg/ha) and RE (14.8\%) across two growth stages. This study shows that combining the Opt-SIs and RF can greatly enhance the prediction accuracy for crop AGB while significantly reduces collinearity and redundancies of spectral data.},

	abstract = {Many empirical models based on hyperspectral indices (HIs) have been developed to estimate nitrogen (N) status of crops. However, most of the researches by far focused on the identification of sensitive bands of HIs, and have not identified the importance of formula formats to achieve their best performance. The current study aimed to investigate the response of band optimization and formula formats to canopy N concentration (CNC) of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants, and to verify the performance of HIs through optimized algorithms based on a multi-site and -year study. Three field experiments involving different potato cultivars with 3–6 N rates were conducted from 2014 to 2016 in Inner Mongolia, China. The band optimization HIs were first tested using a simulated dataset by the PROSAIL model and validation dataset from farmers’ fields. Results showed that the optimized HIs generally had more robust performances for CNC prediction than the published indices. The optimized HIs explained 56\%–74\% of the variations in potato CNC in contrast with 3\%–53\% variation of the published HIs. Compared with published HIs, band optimization could significantly improve the performance of HIs by 16\%–71\%. The choice of the formula formats affected the explanatory power of the optimized HIs by 3\%–18\%. Our study found that both the performance of HIs and the position of the sensitive bands were greatly influenced by formula formats. The results from the evaluation of noise equivalent that independent from farmers’ field and PROSAIL model showed that the best performance was from Opt-CCCI. The central sensitive bands of Opt-CCCI were found at 600, 582, 650 nm. Opt-mRER also exhibited well in noise equivalent and independent validation from farmers’ field, while they could not be verified with the PROSAIL model because of the absence of the wavebands from 340 to 400 nm. Optimization for HIs indicates that there will be a great potential to improve the use of hyperspectral sensing for the estimation of field croṕs CNC.},

However, the feasibility for determining the critical biochemicals, related to the classifications for food, feed, and fuel products are not adequately investigated. Fourier-transform (FT) NIR was applied in this study to determine the eight biochemicals in four types of sorghum samples: hulled grain flours, hull-less grain flours, whole grains, and grain flours. A total of 20 hybrids of sorghum grains were selected from the two locations in China. Followed by FT-NIR spectral and wet-chemically measured biochemical data, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to construct the prediction models. The results showed that sorghum grain morphology and sample format affected the prediction of biochemicals. Using NIR data of grain flours generally improved the prediction compared with the use of NIR data of whole grains. In addition, using the spectra of whole grains enabled comparable predictions, which are recommended when a non-destructive and rapid analysis is required. Compared with the hulled grain flours, hull-less grain flours allowed for improved predictions for tannin, cellulose, and hemicellulose using NIR data. This study aimed to provide a reference for the evaluation of sorghum grain biochemicals for food, feed, and fuel without destruction and complex chemical analysis.},

	abstract = {Knowledge on the response of trees to the urban heat island (UHI) effect and soil sealing is currently limited, yet of vital importance in an era characterized by both climate change and urbanization. We investigated the physiological and phenological leaf plasticity of Tilia×euchlora trees to the UHI effect and soil sealing and explored the potential of leaf optical traits to quantify the magnitude of leaf plasticity. Temporal changes of leaf water content (LWC), specific leaf area (SLA), total chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoids (Car) content, Car:Chl ratio and leaf reflectance for 46 Tilia×euchlora trees were measured along a soil sealing and urbanization gradient. The leaf functional traits displayed trait-specific temporal patterns during the growing season. We observed higher LWC and SLA but lower Chl and Car contents in the coolest zones. We found earlier autumn downregulation in Chl and Car content at paved sites compared to unsealed sites (maximum difference = 13 days). The magnitude of plasticity in relation to the UHI and soil sealing varied in leaf functional traits with largest variation observed in Chl (38\%), followed by Car:Chl (31\%), Car (29\%), SLA (26\%) and LWC (8\%). The proposed spectral indices calculated using leaf reflectance measurements were able to track the spatiotemporal variations and phenology in the leaf functional traits. Our results clearly demonstrate the leaf plasticity of Tilia×euchlora trees, which provides Tilia×euchlora trees the necessary capacity to adapt to rapid changes in the urban environment. More importantly, we demonstrated the suitability of leaf optical traits to serve as a proxy of leaf functional traits for studying the spatiotemporal response of urban trees to environmental factors, which opens up new possibilities for large scale ecological studies using remote sensing.},

The objective of this study is to make use of two different machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) to improve the estimation of leaf area index using multispectral, thermal, and hyperspectral data. The results showed that RF was the best model to improve the accuracy of the LAI estimation compared to the simple linear regression (previous study) and SVM (R2 = 0.91 for RF and R2 = 0.87 for SVM). To evaluate the effects of spectral portions on LAI estimation without calculating the spectral indices, (SI) we inputted each pair of spectral bands for training and testing both RF and SVM. It was found that the best correlation was lower compared to use SIs. However, R2 variations were more homogeneous across the whole spectrum, which suggests that even by using multispectral broadband bands in RF and SVM, a good correlation will be achieved.},

The present research addresses the performance of water and nitrogen-sensitive narrow-band vegetation indices to evaluate the response of sweet maize (Zea mays var. saccharata L.) to different irrigation and nitrogen regimes. The experiment was carried out in Valenzano, Bari (Southern Italy), during the 2020 growing season. Three irrigation regimes (full irrigation, deficit irrigation, and rainfed) and two nitrogen levels (300 and 50 kg ha−1) were tested. During the growing season, a Field Spec Handheld 2 spectroradiometer operating in the range of 325–1075 nm was utilized to capture spectral data regularly. In addition, soil water content, biometric parameters, and physiological parameters were measured. The DATT index, based on near-infrared and red-edge wavelengths, performed better than other indices in explaining the variation in chlorophyll content, whereas the double difference index (DD) showed the greatest correlation with the leaf–gas exchange. The modified normalized difference vegetation index (NNDVI) and the ratio of water band index to normalized difference vegetation index (WBI/NDVI) showed the highest capacity to distinguish the interaction of irrigation x nitrogen, while the best discriminating capability of these indices was under a low nitrogen level. Moreover, red-edge-based indices had higher sensitivity to nitrogen levels compared to the structural and water band indices. Our study highlighted that it is critical to choose proper narrow-band vegetation indices to monitor the plant eco-physiological response to water and nitrogen stresses.},

	abstract = {[Objectives]Monitoring crop moisture conditions in real-time is critical for adopting water-saving irrigation and reducing China’s present water scarcity. This study explores the feasibility of using drone multispectral image data for real-time monitoring of maize drought stress and compares the sensitivity of drone data and field-measured agronomic indicators to crop drought stress. [Methods]Two maize cultivars, ‘Fumin 985’ and ‘Zhengdan 958’, were used as test materials in the field experiment. Border irrigation, drip irrigation, and rainfed irrigation were employed as treatments. The pigment content and specific leaf area (SLA) of the most recently unfolded maize leaves were determined at 60, 70, 76, 84, 90, and 95 days after sowing. Similarly, a UAV equipped with multi-spectral cameras was used to collect near-ground remote sensing data to extract five vegetation indexes: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), leaf chlorophyll index (LCI), and optimum soil adjust vegetation index (OSAVI). [Results]The changes in vegetation indexes were earlier than in the leaf pigment content and the leaf area index. At 70 days after sowing (tasseling period), there was a significant difference in the NDRE and LCI of the three treatments. NDVI, GNDVI, and OSAVI indexes differed between the irrigation and rain-fed modes. No difference was observed in the treatments' pigment content and specific leaf area index at the same stages. At 90 days following sowing, there was a considerable difference in pigment concentration among the treatments (filling period). Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that the relationship between vegetation indexes and pigment content varied depending on the growth stage. The correlations between pigment content and two vegetation indices (NDRE and LCI) were higher for 80 days after sowing (flowering phase) than for NDVI, GNDVI, and OSAVI; for 90 days after sowing (filling period), the correlation between the five vegetation indices and pigment content was high. [Conclusions]According to this study, the utilization of UAV multi-spectral data to monitor maize drought proved better than some measured agronomic indicators. However, further research should be conducted on the best spectral indicators and periods for drought monitoring in various situations and environments. © 2022 by the authors.},

This study focuses on combining VIs acquired by a consumer-grade multiple-spectral UAV and machine learning regression techniques to (i) determine the optimal time window for AGB estimation of winter wheat and to (ii) determine the optimal combination of multi-spectral VIs and regression algorithms. UAV-based multi-spectral data and manually measured AGB of winter wheat, under five nitrogen rates, were obtained from the jointing stage until 25 days after flowering in the growing season 2020/2021. Forty-four multi-spectral VIs were used in the linear regression (LR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF) models in this study. Results of LR models showed that the heading stage was the most suitable stage for AGB prediction, with R2 values varying from 0.48 to 0.93. Three PLSR models based on different datasets performed differently in estimating AGB in the training dataset (R2 = 0.74{\textasciitilde}0.92, RMSE = 0.95{\textasciitilde}2.87 t/ha, MAE = 0.75{\textasciitilde}2.18 t/ha, and RPD = 2.00{\textasciitilde}3.67) and validation dataset (R2 = 0.50{\textasciitilde}0.75, RMSE = 1.56{\textasciitilde}2.57 t/ha, MAE = 1.44{\textasciitilde}2.05 t/ha, RPD = 1.45{\textasciitilde}1.89). Compared with PLSR models, the performance of the RF models was more stable in the prediction of AGB in the training dataset (R2 = 0.95{\textasciitilde}0.97, RMSE = 0.58{\textasciitilde}1.08 t/ha, MAE = 0.46{\textasciitilde}0.89 t/ha, and RPD = 3.95{\textasciitilde}6.35) and validation dataset (R2 = 0.83{\textasciitilde}0.93, RMSE = 0.93{\textasciitilde}2.34 t/ha, MAE = 0.72{\textasciitilde}2.01 t/ha, RPD = 1.36{\textasciitilde}3.79). Monitoring AGB prior to flowering was found to be more effective than post-flowering. Moreover, this study demonstrates that it is feasible to estimate AGB for multiple growth stages of winter wheat by combining the optimal VIs and PLSR and RF models, which overcomes the saturation problem of using individual VI-based linear regression models.},

	abstract = {Deficit irrigation is a common approach in water-scarce regions to balance productivity and water use, whereas drought stress still occurs to various extents, leading to reduced physiological performance and a decrease in yield. Therefore, seeking a rapid and reliable method to identify wheat varieties with drought resistance can help reduce yield loss under water deficit. In this study, we compared ten wheat varieties under three deficit irrigation systems (W0, no irrigation during the growing season; W1, irrigation at jointing; W2, irrigation at jointing and anthesis). UAV thermal imagery, plant physiological traits [leaf area index (LAI), SPAD, photosynthesis (Pn), transpiration (Tr), stomatal conductance (Cn)], biomass and yield were acquired at different growth stages. Wheat drought resistance performance was evaluated through using the canopy temperature extracted from UAV thermal imagery (CT-UAV), in combination with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The CT-UAV of W0 and W1 treatments was significantly higher than in the W2 treatment, with the ranges of 24.8–33.3 °C, 24.3–31.6 °C, and 24.1–28.9 °C in W0, W1 and W2, respectively. We found negative correlations between CT-UAV and LAI, SPAD, Pn, Tr, Cn and biomass under the W0 (R2 = 0.41–0.79) and W1 treatments (R2 = 0.22–0.72), but little relevance for W2 treatment. Under the deficit irrigation treatments (W0 and W1), UAV thermal imagery was less effective before the grain-filling stage in evaluating drought resistance. This study demonstrates the potential of ensuring yield and saving irrigation water by identifying suitable wheat varieties for different water-scarce irrigation scenarios.},

Also, little is known about the performance of UAV-based image texture features in crop nitrogen and NUE monitoring. In this study, eight flying missions were carried out throughout different stages of winter wheat (from the jointing stage to the stage 25 days after flowering) to acquire multispectral images. Forty-three multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and forty texture features (TFs) were calculated from images and fed into the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF) regression models for predicting nitrogen-related indicators. Our main purposes were to (1) evaluate the potential of UAV-based images to predict NC in different organs of winter wheat and nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE); (2) compare the performances of VIs, TFs and the combination of them for nitrogen monitoring. The results showed that the correlation between different features (VIs and TFs) and NC in different organs varied between the vegetative and reproductive phases. Most of VIs were found to be positively correlated with NC, while most of the TFs were negatively correlated with NC. PLSR latent variables extracted from VIs and TFs explained 80\% of the variations in NAE. However, no significant differences were found between VIs and TFs in their performance in predicting NC in different organs. This study demonstrated the promise of applying UAV-based imaging to estimate NC and NAE in different organs of winter wheat.},

Rating the coloring visually is difficult and measuring canopy reflectance by a multispectral canopy might be more accurate. Reflectance of barley canopies with different awn coloring levels was measured from different viewing angles using a multispectral camera mounted to an unmanned aerial vehicle. The bi-directional reflectance distribution of the canopies was determined and used for deriving the anthocyanin reflection index, which was then used to identify the optimal viewing angles for the detection of Barley awn coloring. The index differed between the canopies without awn coloring and the canopies with awn coloring.

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing technology provides a promising means for near real-time monitoring of crop water status and requirements in agricultural and hydrological applications. Estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) often requires thermal information; however, not every satellite is equipped with a thermal sensor, which limits the estimation of ETa. To address this limitation, here we propose a satellite-based ETa estimation model, OPTRAM-ET, based on the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) estimates of soil moisture and a vegetation index (VI). We applied the OPTRAM-ET model to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data and evaluated the model for ETa estimates using 16 eddy covariance flux towers in the United States and Germany with different landcover types, including agriculture, orchard, permanent wetland, and foothill forests. Next, OPTRAM-ET was compared with the conventional land surface temperature (LST)-VI model. The proposed OPTRAM-ET model showed promising performance over all the studied landcover types. In addition, OPTRAM-ET showed comparable performance to the conventional LST-VI model. However, since the OPTRAM-ET model does not need thermal data, it benefits from higher spatial and temporal resolution data provided by ever-increasing drone- and satellite-based optical sensors to predict crop water status and demand. Unlike the LST-VI model, which needs to be calibrated for each satellite image, a temporally-invariant region-specific calibration is possible in the OPTRAM-ET model. Therefore, OPTRAM-ET is substantially less computationally demanding than the LST-VI model.},

	abstract = {Context
Remotely estimating plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) at the vegetative growth stage plays a crucial role in the precision N management of field crops. However, the great challenges still remain on how to overcome the impact of canopy structure variation and the ‘N-dilution’ effect on the accuracy of PNC assessment using spectral indices (SIs).
Objective
This study was to apply machine learning (ML) algorithms fed with the optimized spectral indices (OSI), sensitive spectral bands (SSB), and full-spectrum (FS) to improve the prediction accuracy of PNC in critical vegetative growth stages of wheat, maize, rice, potato and the across crops.
Methods
Four ML algorithms including the partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were compared for their efficacies in predicting PNC from ten field trials in different locations from 2005 to 2016.
Results
The input variable had a non-negligible influence on the performance of ML models. The OSI was the most efficient input variable for the tested ML algorithms in predicting PNC. The OSI-based RF models showed consistent outperformance compared to other models regardless of crops. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.51˗0.85 and the root means square error (RMSE) was 0.15\% ˗ 0.34\% in the experimental validation datasets. By choosing PNC-related spectral features across crops, the OSI-based RF models increased prediction accuracy by 10–31\% compared with the best OSI-simple regression models, which was because the OSI-based RF models may be independent of canopy structure or the "N-dilution" impact. The simulated datasets based on the PROSAIL model and satellite multispectral bands further validated the results.
Conclusions
Our study concludes that the OSI-based RF is a robust and effective model to predict crop PNC at the vegetative growth stage.
Significance
The results of this study may provide insights into how to improve PNC assessment using the OSI-based RF models and deploy ML-based N recommendation models in the next generation of crop sensors.},

However, deployment and evaluation of the models for real-time detection as well as for crop counting under varying real field conditions is lacking. In this work, two versions of a state-of-the-art object detection model—YOLOv5n and YOLOv5s—were deployed and evaluated for cassava detection. We compared the performance of the models when trained with different input image resolutions, images of different growth stages, weed interference, and illumination conditions. The models were deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin embedded GPU in order to observe the real-time performance of the models. Results of a use case in a farm field showed that YOLOv5s yielded the best accuracy whereas YOLOv5n had the best inference speed in detecting cassava plants. YOLOv5s allowed for more precise crop counting, compared to the YOLOv5n which mis-detected cassava plants. YOLOv5s performed better under weed interference at the cost of a low speed. The findings of this work may serve to as a reference for making a choice of which model fits an intended real-life plant detection application, taking into consideration the need for a trade-off between of detection speed, detection accuracy, and memory usage.},

This review examines the capabilities of UASs in assessing NUE in crops. Our analysis specifically highlights how different growth stages critically influence NUE and biomass assessments in crops and reveals a significant impact of specific signal processing techniques and sensor types on the accuracy of remote sensing data. Optimized flight parameters and precise sensor calibration are underscored as key for ensuring the reliability and validity of collected data. Additionally, the review delves into how different canopy structures, like planophile and erect leaf orientations, uniquely influence spectral data interpretation. The study also recognizes the untapped potential of image texture features in UAV-based remote sensing for detailed analysis of canopy micro-architecture. Overall, this research not only underscores the transformative impact of UAS technology on agricultural productivity and sustainability but also demonstrates its potential in providing more accurate and comprehensive insights for effective crop health and nutrient management strategies.},

In this study, we evaluated the performance of different types of spectral bands and indices (SIs) coupled with ensemble learning models (ELMs) at retrieving the plant N concentration (PNC) and plant aboveground biomass (AGB) of potato from Sentinel-2 images. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 imagery was acquired during the tuber-formation to starch-accumulation stages from 2020 to 2021. Fourteen optimal SIs were selected using the successive projections algorithm (SPA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The PNC and AGB estimation models were then built using an ELMs. The results showed that the SIs based on chlorophyll absorption bands were strongly related to potato PNC and AGB. Also, the N-correlated bands were mainly concentrated in the red-edge (705 nm) and short-wave infrared (1610 and 2190 nm) regions. The ELMs successfully predicted PNC and AGB (R2PNC = 0.74; R2AGB = 0.82). Compared with the other five base models (k-nearest neighbor (KNN), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and Gaussian process regression (GPR)), the ELMs provided higher PNC and AGB estimation accuracy and effectively reduced overfitting to training data. This study demonstrated that the promising solution of using SPA-PCA coupled with an ensemble learning model improves the estimation accuracy of potato PNC and AGB based on Sentinel-2 imagery data.},

Furthermore, introducing image-rotation augmentation and low noise weight enhanced model accuracy, with an increase of 0.024 and 0.016 mAP@0.5, respectively, compared to the original model of the 3-leaf stage.

	abstract = {High throughput field phenotyping techniques employing multispectral cameras allow extracting a variety of variables and features to predict yield and yield related traits, but little is known about which types of multispectral features are optimal to forecast yield potential in the early growth phase. In this study, we aim to identify multispectral features that are able to accurately predict yield and aid in variety classification at different growth stages throughout the season. Furthermore, we hypothesize that texture features (TFs) are more suitable for variety classification than for yield prediction. Throughout 2021 and 2022, a trial involving 19 and 18 European wheat varieties, respectively, was conducted. Multispectral images, encompassing visible, Red-edge, and near-infrared (NIR) bands, were captured at 19 and 22 time points from tillering to harvest using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the first and second year of trial. Subsequently, orthomosaic images were generated, and various features were extracted, including single-band reflectances, vegetation indices (VI), and TFs derived from a gray level correlation matrix (GLCM). The performance of these features in predicting yield and classifying varieties at different growth stages was assessed using random forest models. Measurements during the flowering stage demonstrated superior performance for most features. Specifically, Red reflectance achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 52.4 g m-2 in the first year and 64.4 g m-2 in the second year. The NDRE VI yielded the most accurate predictions with an RMSE of 49.1 g m-2 and 60.6 g m-2, respectively. Moreover, TFs such as CONTRAST and DISSIMILARITY displayed the best performance in predicting yield, with RMSE values of 55.5 g m-2 and 66.3 g m-2 across the two years of trial. Combining data from different dates enhanced yield prediction and stabilized predictions across dates. TFs exhibited high accuracy in classifying low and high-yielding varieties. The CORRELATION feature achieved an accuracy of 88\% in the first year, while the HOMOGENEITY feature reached 92\% accuracy in the second year. This study confirms the hypothesis that TFs are more suitable for variety classification than for yield prediction. The results underscore the potential of TFs derived from multispectral images in early yield prediction and varietal classification, offering insights for HTP and precision agriculture alike.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are increasingly vital in precision agriculture, offering detailed, real-time insights into plant health across multiple spectral domains. However, this technology’s precision in estimating plant traits associated with Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), and the factors affecting this precision, are not well-documented. This review examines the capabilities of UASs in assessing NUE in crops. Our analysis specifically highlights how different growth stages critically influence NUE and biomass assessments in crops and reveals a significant impact of specific signal processing techniques and sensor types on the accuracy of remote sensing data. Optimized flight parameters and precise sensor calibration are underscored as key for ensuring the reliability and validity of collected data. Additionally, the review delves into how different canopy structures, like planophile and erect leaf orientations, uniquely influence spectral data interpretation. The study also recognizes the untapped potential of image texture features in UAV-based remote sensing for detailed analysis of canopy micro-architecture. Overall, this research not only underscores the transformative impact of UAS technology on agricultural productivity and sustainability but also demonstrates its potential in providing more accurate and comprehensive insights for effective crop health and nutrient management strategies.},

	abstract = {Drone remote sensing has been increasingly demonstrated its unique advantage of monitoring vegetation and agricultural systems, yet the degree to which the effectiveness of drone imaging based spectral features may differ in assessing the effect of soil nutrient availability on plant canopy is unclear. Soil mineralized nitrogen (Nmin) is a key factor determining crop N fertilization demand, and thus understanding its effect on yield and quality is critical for efficient fertilizer use and precise crop N management and assessing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). In this study, our objective was to understand how soil Nmin variability is associated canopy characteristics, and whether these associations are also interact with grain yield, quality and NUE. For this purpose, we employed UAV multispectral remote sensing, and plant and grain sampling and sample N content determination in wheat growing at different Nmin levels. We extracted 63 spectral features (25 texture features, canopy height, 5 multispectral bands, and 23 spectral indices) obtained from eight UAV flights of RGB and multispectral images. Effective indicators were selected using random forests and correlation, and 10 machine learning models were used to predict NUE. We identified CH, NGRDI, NDREg, and IPCA as the most predictive factors for NUE (r {\textgreater} 0.7), and the PLSR model (R2 {\textgreater} 0.8) as the best performing model. We found that the impact of Nmin on wheat primarily involves enhancing canopy structure, promoting the expansion of leaf area, thereby increasing grain yield and NUE under moderate nitrogen fertilizer levels. In contrast, there was no significant effect found on grain quality. Results also demonstrated that the red edge spectral indices and color-band indices were effective in predicting NUE as early as the flowering stage. This study demonstrates the potential of UAV remote sensing for capturing soil N effect on canopy traits and for assessing nitrogen use efficiency for the purpose of improving fertilizer utilization and environmental effects.},

	abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form mutualistic relationships with the majority of land plants and are an important part of the soil microbial community in natural and agricultural ecosystems. These fungi promote water and nutrient acquisition by their host plant and regulate the allocation of photosynthetic carbon to soil. Both crop variety and environment affect naturally occurring mycorrhizal abundance in roots, but the relative importance of those factors for mycorrhization is largely unknown. In a field study covering a large pedoclimatic gradient across four European sites, we (i) compared the abundance of AM fungi in the roots of 10 modern winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties, (ii) evaluated the relative importance of variety and site for the variability in root colonization by AM fungi and (iii) tested the relationship between mycorrhizal abundance and grain yield. Root colonization by arbuscules and hyphae ranged from 10\% to 59\% and 20\% to 91\%, respectively, across all samples and varied by 8\% and 18\%, respectively, among varieties when averaged across sites. Variance decomposition analysis revealed a 10 times higher importance of site than variety for AM fungal root colonization. Specifically, we found the highest mycorrhizal abundance on the site with the most arid conditions and the lowest on the sites with low soil pH and high nutrient availability. Despite the low variability in mycorrhizal abundance among varieties, there were significant differences in both arbuscular and hyphal root colonization. However, this did not translate into an increase in yield as no significant relationships between mycorrhizal abundance at flowering and grain yield were detected. The consistent differences between wheat varieties in root colonization by AM fungi across European field sites underline that genetic drivers of mycorrhization are to some extent independent of the site. This highlights the relevance of breeding practices to shape a wheat variety's capacity for mycorrhizal symbiosis across a range of environmental conditions.},
